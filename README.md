## Abstract
This doctoral thesis aims to analyze political elite clashes over public provision in rural Brazil from the 1920s through 1940s, when the country was experiencing modernization and state building processes. After the Brazilian Revolution of 1930 there was no specific regulation of rural work, nor extension of social rights to the countryside or agrarian reform. I compare negotiations regarding access to land through colonization policies, education and health policies that specifically targeted rural populations, the organization of agrarian classes through the creation of cooperatives, and policy priorities for managing the droughts in the Northeast of the country. The goal is to clarify attitude variations within the elites and to compare power resources that they have used to pursue their projects. The analysis is based on text mining and qualitative analysis of the Personal Archive of Juarez Távora, a military and revolutionary hero who acted as Minister of Agriculture under the Getúlio Vargas Administration. Elite coordination and collective action point out to two competing political projects in dispute within the State: a project of tutelary interventionism that was more excludent for rural populations, and another project of reformist interventionism, of a more distributive nature for rural populations. The two projects can be framed within the Conservative Modernization model.
